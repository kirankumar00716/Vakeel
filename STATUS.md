# Vakeel Application Status

## Completed

### Backend
1. ✅ Set up the project structure with FastAPI
2. ✅ Implemented database models using SQLAlchemy
3. ✅ Created authentication system with JWT
4. ✅ Implemented user management endpoints
5. ✅ Created legal query API with mock LLM service
6. ✅ Added query history and saved queries functionality
7. ✅ Configured database connection (SQLite)
8. ✅ Successfully tested all API endpoints:
   - User registration
   - User login (token generation)
   - User profile management
   - Legal query submission and retrieval
   - Query history

### Frontend (Designed, but not yet deployed)
1. ✅ Created Flutter project structure
2. ✅ Implemented screens for the app UI
3. ✅ Added service classes for API communication
4. ✅ Implemented authentication logic
5. ✅ Designed query and history screens

## Current Status
The backend is fully functional and running on http://localhost:8080. It uses a mock LLM service that provides realistic legal responses without requiring the heavyweight Llama2 model.

## Next Steps

### Backend
1. Optional: Integrate with an actual LLM service when more resources are available
2. Add more comprehensive error handling
3. Expand the test coverage

### Frontend
1. Install Flutter SDK to run the frontend application
2. Test the frontend screens with the working backend
3. Package the application for Android/iOS devices

## How to Run

### Backend
Run the following command from the root directory:
```bash
run_backend.bat
```
Or directly:
```bash
cd backend
python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --reload
```

### Frontend (When Flutter is installed)
Run the following command from the root directory:
```bash
run_frontend.bat
```
Or directly:
```bash
cd frontend
flutter run
```

## Testing the API
You can test the API using the Swagger documentation available at:
http://localhost:8080/docs

Or use curl/PowerShell for API testing:
```powershell
# Register a new user
$body = @{
    username = "testuser"
    email = "test@example.com"
    password = "Password123!"
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:8080/api/register" -Method Post -ContentType "application/json" -Body $body

# Login to get an access token
$loginData = @{
    username = "testuser"
    password = "Password123!"
    grant_type = ""
}

$response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:8080/api/token" -Method Post -ContentType "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -Body $loginData
$result = $response.Content | ConvertFrom-Json
$token = $result.access_token

# Submit a legal query
$headers = @{
    "Authorization" = "Bearer $token"
    "Content-Type" = "application/json"
}

$queryBody = @{
    query = "What are my rights as a tenant if my landlord refuses to make necessary repairs?"
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:8080/api/legal/query" -Method Post -Headers $headers -Body $queryBody
```
